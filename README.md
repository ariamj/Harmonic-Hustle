# Team-2-Harmonic-Hustle

### Background

After being forced to listen to a neighbour's outrageous late night parties with terrible music, you decide to take action and battle the musical offenders. 

Our game will have one primary zone resembling a city, with up to three different enemies within functioning as mini-levels. Encounters with higher level enemies will cause the game to reset while encounters with the correct level enemies will result in a rhythmic battle esequence. To advance, the player must time their keyboard inputs against the enemyâ€™s musical notes precisely enough to score above a certain threshold. Losing will cause the current enemy sprite to disappear, exhausted after the battle. The player will then have to find another current level enemy. Red enemies are higher level and represent challenge battles. Winning these challenges will automaticaly let the player advance and skip levels. Losing will mean losing a life. Player is initially given 3 lives, and once these lives run out, game over.
